### 🎮This game was made for the 2023 GMTK Game Jam.
The theme for this game jam was *Roles Reversed*. I took inspiration from this by making a game where you review the host of the game jam, Mark Brown, instead of him reviewing your game. In total, I spent 38 of the 48 hours given working on the game.
### ❔Description
*Mark Brown Jam 2023* is a MadLibs-style game where you are given a random "Mark Brown" and a randomly generated text prompt, and are asked to fill in the blanks. The game was made in unity and most assets were made in Blender.
### 🗣️Results and Feedback
I was pleasently surprised with what I was able to turn out in 48 hours. If I had more time I would have liked to give more randomization options to the prompts, as they get repetitive quite quickly. I would also have made the controls a bit more intuitive.
